    <h2>Tough Question...</h2>
    <p>Why is this a tough question, you might ask? Well, I'm a dog person. Usually my default answer for this is "Dog!" or "Puppies!" Or something in that vein. However, I felt like going outside of the box today.</p>
    <p>Today, my favorite animal is this specific hermit crab I found on the beach:</p> 
    <img src="hc.JPG" alt="Small Hermit Crab on the beach" height="400px">
    <p>Impossibly small, I almost didn't notice him and could have stepped on him. Very cute and very fast, he made a lasting impression on me, and I took unecessary amounts of pictures (like this one) and videos with my phone, NatGeo style.</p>

    <h3>Why He's So Great</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>His shell would have saved him if I stepped on him</li>
            <li>He has more legs than me</li>
            <li>He has incredibly cheap housing and moving costs are next to nothing</li>
            <li>He lives on an island in the Bahamas, something I may never achieve</li>
            <li>He's v photogenic</li>
        </ul>
